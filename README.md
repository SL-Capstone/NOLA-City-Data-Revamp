## EXPO-Ready Product ##


### Progress since last commit: ###
Major headway on fleshing out 3 distinct dashboards. Dropped code enforcement dashboard to further work on and expand Crime and Blight Map, NOPD Misconduct, and Stop-and-Search dashboards. These were all things requested by the city government and as such we decided to address these topic with the polish and thoroughness that has the best chance of bringing some tangible benefit to them. 

The intial forms of each of the dashboards were presented and demonstrated at milestone 6, with a consistent implementation of new features including the ability for data to be updated on a daily basis, the presentation and look of the map/graphs, and the addition of even more relevant statistics/evidence.

We also have put a lot of effort into the execution of our final project, sending a draft of our poster to our mentor for review as well as practicing our expo-day pitch with our mentor and setting up another time to meet with Eric (our government contact) to present our finished product.

While version control through Power BI using github is impossible and any form of version control requires the premium version of the service (https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Service/Power-BI-Version-control-options/m-p/2424207), I hope the updates in here as well as the project management tool as well as comments from our mentor will suffice.

## Elevator Pitch: ##
Our team recently completed a community service project where we analyzed the government-run site "datadrivennola.gov." Using Natural Language Processing techniques, we examined user feedback to identify significant requests and inefficiencies that needed addressing. Based on our analysis, we developed a comprehensive data analysis deck that highlights specific patterns in user requests for fixing issues or adding new features. The culmination of our work resulted in a user-friendly dashboard that presents in-depth data analysis of the most pressing needs expressed by the New Orleans government. By producing new insights into New Orleans' datasets and presenting them in an accessible format, we have created a powerful analytics tool for both "datadrivennola.gov" and its users. Our work has revealed new insights in the data provided and helped the government to better serve the community.


### Abstract (ver final): ###
Per our service learning requirement, our team researched and identified significant requests and inefficiencies that could be addressed on the government-run site "datadriven.nola.gov." We analyzed data about the usage and requests for data the NOLA City Government receives using techniques from Data Science and Natural Language Processing in consultation with city partners. Through these methods, we created a data analysis deck identifying specific patterns in user requests. We incorporated the results of this analysis into interactive dashboards to address some of the most prominent needs expressed by the New Orleans Government. By producing new insights into New Orleans' datasets and presenting them in these comprehensive dashboards, we hope that they can serve as a useful analytics tool for both "datadriven.nola.gov" and its users.
