## Weekly update 3/03/23 ##


### Current Progress: ###  Further unification of group efforts towards one common goal on our dashboard. Working on linking 3 datasets (address/location of cameras, address/location of blight (code violations), and address/location of crime) to further expand our data analysis and insights to provide tangible new information to the people at datadrivennola.org.

Also looking at methods to have the data dynamically update as some of the datasets are updated daily and would quickly be outdated otherwise.

### Pitch Notes (From Prof Mattei): ###

* pol dashboards: city council council.nola.gov dashboards

* criminal justice coordination — communication and process between branches of the system - jail admissions, proc decisions — nothing around misconduct

* nola.gov/next/apps — maps and apps, NOPD has several dashboards that are available NOPD news transparency dashboards

* one thing that is missing is a misconduct dashboard

* build off field interviews dataset — “stop and search” — this is the dataset to use misconduct data — monitoring data — in theory we could use calls for service item and then track to field interview card # — call is a call for service and interaction is in the field interview card, in 911 data there may be an initial reason for the call — then there is a final reason that would be in the field interview card

* same as above with misconduct, — interaction should be in the field interview cards

* might be challenging to link the misconduct complaint to the field interview card

* ARPA funding — recover act funding, trying to eliminate blight to impact crime — this study has been done before, blight v crime. is it true? if it is true, where are the areas we should target

* Can we bring something together blighted properties and crime?

* stc different than holly grove, is it abandoned, ready to fall, overgrown,

* crime happens where people are not? — can we integrate the cameras (nola.gov/rtcc — have

* GIS portal — migrating — @Julian to connect on that — https://portal-nolagis.opendata.arcgis.com/ — not all there yet (connect with eric on that)

* have traffic camera map — is available in PDF — https://maps.nola.gov/portal/home/

* re: blight — find areas are they problematic — use the code enforcement data set but it’s super imprecise can we leverage that

* Code enforcement inspector — step 1: code enforcement + crime data and seeing those together as one types of crimes / proximity (what are the definitions) —

* where should the city spend money first

* https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30286299/ — blight in new orleans 

* newer crimemap: https://communitycrimemap.com/?address=New%20Orleans,LA&startDate=30&endDate=0

* Dataset mash up

### Abstract (ver 2): ###
Per our community service requirement, our team researched and identified significant requests and inefficiencies that could be addressed on the government-run site "datadrivennola.gov." Using NLP, Sentiment analysis, and categorical data analysis, we created a data analysis deck identifying specific patterns in user requests to fix problems or add specific features. We incorporated the results of this analysis into a polished and accessible dashboard with in-depth data analysis of some of the most prominent needs expressed by the New Orleans government. By producing new insights into New Orlean's datasets and presenting them in an easy-to-use format, we have created a powerful analytics tool for both "datadrivennola.gov" and its users.
