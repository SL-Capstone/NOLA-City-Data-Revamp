#NOLA-City-Data-Revamp

#Current Progress: 
Completed Pitch on 2/3/13, working towards transitioning from Phase 1 of the project (research/data analysis) to Phase 2 (working/constructing dashboard for the city). Logistics on the site building front out of our control, but preparing for when we have more insight.

#Abstract:
Per our community service requirement, our team set out to research and identify significant inefficiencies that could be addressed on the government run site "datadrivennola.gov." Using NLP, Sentiment analysis, and other out-of-the-box text and categorical data analysis techniques, we created a comprehensive list of what users of the site were searching for and if there was a pattern in requests to fix specific problems or add specific features. We incorporated the results of this comprehensive analysis by crafting a polished and easy-to-use dashboard that included thorough data analysis for the most popular datasets on the site and addressed some of the prominent issues users of the site criticized it for. It is our belief that having created a more open and efficient way of obtaining dataset statistics #will greatly benefit users who want to extract important metrics from the datasets, but are not proficient enough in coding to do so.
