## Weekly update 2/24/23 ##


### Current Progress: 1st Draft Dashboard with Preliminary Data Analaysis Deployed. Working on expanding on that to make more meaningful Analysis through more complex methods of analysis. ### 


### Pitch Notes (From Prof Mattei): ###

* pol dashboards: city council council.nola.gov dashboards

* criminal justice coordination — communication and process between branches of the system - jail admissions, proc decisions — nothing around misconduct

* nola.gov/next/apps — maps and apps, NOPD has several dashboards that are available NOPD news transparency dashboards

* one thing that is missing is a misconduct dashboard

* build off field interviews dataset — “stop and search” — this is the dataset to use misconduct data — monitoring data — in theory we could use calls for service item and then track to field interview card # — call is a call for service and interaction is in the field interview card, in 911 data there may be an initial reason for the call — then there is a final reason that would be in the field interview card

* same as above with misconduct, — interaction should be in the field interview cards

* might be challenging to link the misconduct complaint to the field interview card

* ARPA funding — recover act funding, trying to eliminate blight to impact crime — this study has been done before, blight v crime. is it true? if it is true, where are the areas we should target

* Can we bring something together blighted properties and crime?

* stc different than holly grove, is it abandoned, ready to fall, overgrown,

* crime happens where people are not? — can we integrate the cameras (nola.gov/rtcc — have

* GIS portal — migrating — @Julian to connect on that — https://portal-nolagis.opendata.arcgis.com/ — not all there yet (connect with eric on that)

* have traffic camera map — is available in PDF — https://maps.nola.gov/portal/home/

* re: blight — find areas are they problematic — use the code enforcement data set but it’s super imprecise can we leverage that

* Code enforcement inspector — step 1: code enforcement + crime data and seeing those together as one types of crimes / proximity (what are the definitions) —

* where should the city spend money first

* https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30286299/ — blight in new orleans 

* newer crimemap: https://communitycrimemap.com/?address=New%20Orleans,LA&startDate=30&endDate=0

* Dataset mash up

### Abstract: ###
Per our community service requirement, our team set out to research and identify significant inefficiencies that could be addressed on the government run site "datadrivennola.gov." Using NLP, Sentiment analysis, and other out-of-the-box text and categorical data analysis techniques, we created a comprehensive list of what users of the site were searching for and if there was a pattern in requests to fix specific problems or add specific features. We incorporated the results of this comprehensive analysis by crafting a polished and easy-to-use dashboard that included thorough data analysis for the most popular datasets on the site and addressed some of the prominent issues users of the site criticized it for. It is our belief that having created a more open and efficient way of obtaining dataset statistics #will greatly benefit users who want to extract important metrics from the datasets, but are not proficient enough in coding to do so.
