## Milestone 6 ##


### Current Progress: ###
Created dashboard map comparing blight, crime, and camera locations as an effort to narrow our work towards a collective research insight (rather than multiple research insights with less depth). Preparation for Milestone 6 underway.

## Elevator Pitch: ##
Our team recently completed a community service project where we analyzed the government-run site "datadrivennola.gov." Using Natural Language Processing techniques, we examined user feedback to identify significant requests and inefficiencies that needed addressing. Based on our analysis, we developed a comprehensive data analysis deck that highlights specific patterns in user requests for fixing issues or adding new features. The culmination of our work resulted in a user-friendly dashboard that presents in-depth data analysis of the most pressing needs expressed by the New Orleans government. By producing new insights into New Orleans' datasets and presenting them in an accessible format, we have created a powerful analytics tool for both "datadrivennola.gov" and its users. Our work has revealed new insights in the data provided and helped the government to better serve the community.


### Abstract (ver 2): ###
Per our community service requirement, our team researched and identified significant requests and inefficiencies that could be addressed on the government-run site "datadrivennola.gov." Using NLP, Sentiment analysis, and categorical data analysis, we created a data analysis deck identifying specific patterns in user requests to fix problems or add specific features. We incorporated the results of this analysis into a polished and accessible dashboard with in-depth data analysis of some of the most prominent needs expressed by the New Orleans government. By producing new insights into New Orlean's datasets and presenting them in an easy-to-use format, we have created a powerful analytics tool for both "datadrivennola.gov" and its users.
